As a developer, you need to create lots of objects
	1. You are also responsibe for destroying the object but, you never did it
		(you always leave it on to GC)
	2. Access of the object, shareing the object (Lifecycle of an object)
		share the same object between 
			multiple request
			multiplle user
			a new object for every request

	MS said, now, Runtime, will take care of both the above challanges (from .net core onwards)
	Think about 100 of object (20 page website)

	NOTE: you are not suppose to use, new keyword now onwards
		EmployeeDBContexct db = new EmployeeDBContexct (); XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
		EmployeeDBContexct  db;
			

		All the major config will be in startup.cs
	
before .net core, you had something called, IOC
